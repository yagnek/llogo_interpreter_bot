## Logo in Telegram

[Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)) is a programming language designed in 1967. It introduced turtle graphics, widely used to teach kids programming.

This project is an implementation of a minimalist but Turing-complete Logo-like programming language, with an interpreter that works right in Telegram.
